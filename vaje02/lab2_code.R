# EXAMPLE 2: Model fitting

# We consider a data on the growth of trees

Vol <- c(2.2, 20.0, 93.0, 262.0, 476.0, 705.0, 967.0, 1203.0, 1409.0, 1659.0, 1898.0, 2106.0)

plot(Age, Vol)

# An ecological model for the plant size (measured by volume) as a function of age is the Richards curve:
# f(x) = a*(1-exp(-b*x))^c, where a, b, in c are the model parameters

# Let's fit the Richards curve using genetic algorithms

# We first define our model function (argument params represents a vector of the parameters a, b, and c) 
model <- function(params)
{
  params[1] * (1 - exp(-params[2] * Age))^params[3]

# We define the fitness function as the sum of squares of the differences between estimated and observed data
myFitness2 <- function(params) 
{
  -sum((Vol - model(params))^2)

# The fitness function needs to be maximized with respect to the model's parameters, given the observed data in x and y.
# A blend crossover is used for improving the search over the parameter space: for two parents x1 and x2 (assume x1 < x2) 
# it randomly picks a solution in the range [x1 - k*(x2-x1), x2 + k*(x2-x1)], where k represents a constant between 0 and 1.


# We restrict the search interval for a,b, and c to [1000.0, 5000.0], [0.0, 5.0], and [0.0, 5.0], respectively.

# EXAMPLE 3: The Knapsack problem
#
#

# The Knapsack problem is defined as follows: given a set of items, each with a mass and a value, determine the subset 
# of items to be included in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value 
# is as large as possible.

# a vector of the items' values
values <- c(5, 8, 3, 4, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2)

# a vector of the item's weights
weights <- c(1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5)

# the knapsack capacity
Capacity <- 10

# A binary GA can be used to solve the knapsack problem. The solution to this problem is a binary string equal to the number 
# of items where the ith bit is 1 if the ith item is in the subset and 0 otherwise. The fitness function should penalize 
# unfeasible solutions.

  f <- sum(x * values)
  w <- sum(x * weights)

# Example 4: ESTABLISHING A TIMETABLE
#

# A small football club has a youth team and a senior team. The player 
# training program has seven components: stamina training, strength training, 
# technique, tactics, psychological preparation, teamwork, and regeneration. 
# Due to lack of funds, for each component, a single staff member is responsible 
# for both the youth and the senior team, with the exceptions of tactics and 
# stamina training, where two staff members are assigned, one to each team.
# 
# The weekly training regime is summarized in the following table:
# 
#+----------+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
#| Coach    | Component           | Senior team     | Youth team      |
#+----------+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
#| Anze     | Strength training   | 1 time a week   | 1 time a week   |
#| Bojan    | Technique           | 3 times a week  | 3 times a week  |
#| Ciril    | Regeneration        | 2 times a week  | 2 times a week  |
#| Dusan    | Stamina training    | doesn't conduct | 4 times a week  |
#| Erik     | Stamina training    | 4 times a week  | doesn't conduct |
#| Filip    | Teamwork            | 3 times a week  | 3 times a week  |
#| Gasper   | Psychological prep. | 1 time a week   | 1 time a week   |
#| Hugo     | Tactics             | 1 time a week   | doesn't conduct |
#| Iztok    | Tactics             | doesn't conduct | 1 time a week   |
#+----------+---------------------+-----------------+-----------------+
#
# Training is performed from Monday to Friday in four different time slots: 
#    8:00 - 10:00, 10:15 - 12:15, 14:00 - 16:00, and 16:15 - 18:15.
# 
# Constraints:
#
# - each time slot can hold only one component for the youth team and one component 
#   for the senior team (the youth and senior teams train separately, so a single
#   staff member can only train one of the two teams in a single time slot). 
# 
# - a team is not allowed to train the same component 2 or more times within one day.
# 
# - the main purpose of the Tactics training component is to prepare the team for 
#   the upcoming match. Matches are usually played during the weekend, so Tactics 
#   training should be scheduled for Thursday in the 16:15 - 18:15 time slot.
# 
# - after a match, the players need to rest. Therefore, there is no training in 
#   the Monday 8:00 - 10:00 time slot.
#
# - the stamina training coach Dusan is not available on Monday mornings 
#   (8:00 - 10:00 in 10:15 - 12:15 time slots)
#
# - there can be no Technique training on Wednesdays, because coach Bojan is 
#   not available.
#
#
# Produce a training schedule that takes into account these two and all of 
# the above restrictions!
#

# VARIABLES

# senior     - number of sessions per component for the senior team
# youth      - number of sessions per component for the youth team
