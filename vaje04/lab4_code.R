# INTRODUCTION TO CLASSIFICATION
#
#

#
# Work plan:
#
# - Read in the data
# - Split the data into training and test sets
# - Build a model using the training set
# - Evaluate the model using the test set
#



# Please download the data file "players.txt" into a local directory
# then set that directory as the current working directory of R.
# You can achive this using the "setwd" command or by selecting "File -> Change dir..."


# We are going to use the packages: rpart, and pROC. 
# Make sure that the packages are installed.
#
# You install a package in R with the function install.packages():
#
#     install.packages("pROC")
#     library(pROC)
#
# To install packages without root access:
#
#     install.packages("pROC", lib="/mylibs/Rpackages/")
#     library(pROC, lib.loc="/mylibs/Rpackages/")
#

# Read in the dataset 
players <- read.table("players.txt", header = T, sep = ",")

# Get the summary statistics of the data
summary(players)

# ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!
#
# The "id" attribute uniquely identifies a player within our data set. 
# This attribute cannot be used to classify new players as they will 
# have different id numbers.
# 
# Before we continue, we have to remove the "id" attribute from our data set!

# Prediction of playing position
#
############################################################################


#
# We want to build a model to predict a player's playing position 
# with respect to the given player's statistics.
#
# The target variable "position" is discrete - we term this a classification task.   
#
# We aim to verify whether or not it is possible to use historical data to predict
# playing positions for new players. 
#

# We are going to split the data into a training and testing data set.
# The training data set consists of players that ended their careers before 1999.
# The test data set consists of players that began their careers after 1999.

learn <- players[players$lastseason <= 1999,]
test <- players[players$firstseason > 1999,]

# We used the "firstseason" and "lastseason" attributes to split the data.
# Therefore the attributes are not going to contribute to the modelling task, so
# we will remove them.

learn$firstseason <- NULL
learn$lastseason <- NULL

test$firstseason <- NULL
test$lastseason <- NULL

# We inspect the target values distribution in the defined data sets.
# (number of examples and frequency of individual classes)

nrow(learn)
table(learn$position)

nrow(test)
table(test$position)




#
#
# MAJORITY CLASSIFIER
#
#


# The majority class is the class with the highest number of training examples
which.max(table(learn$position))

majority.class <- names(which.max(table(learn$position)))
majority.class

# The majority classifier classifies all test instances into the majority class.
# The accuracy of the majority class
sum(test$position == majority.class) / length(test$position)




#
#
# DECISION TREES
#
#


# load the "rpart" package that implements decision trees in R
library(rpart)

# Fit a decision tree
dt <- rpart(position ~ ., data = learn)

#
# The first argument of the rpart function is a model formula that indicates 
# the functional form of the model. The "~" symbol stands for "modeled as".
#
# The formula "position ~ . " states that we want a model that predicts the 
# target attribute "position" using all other attributes present in the data 
# (which is the meaning of the "." character).
# 
# If we wanted, for example, a model for the "position" attribute as a function 
# of the attributes "height", "width", and "pts", we should have 
# indicated the formula as "position ~ height + weight + pts".  
# 
# The second argument of the rpart function provides the training examples.
#


# The content of the dt object 
dt

# A graphical representation of our tree
plot(dt)
text(dt, pretty = 1)

# To navigate the tree, start from the root node. If the attribute of the 
# observation satisfies the logical test, then navigate down the left branch.
# Otherwise navigate down the right branch. Continue until a leaf node is reached.
# A leaf node represents a class label (or class label distribution). 


# Observed values in the test samples (the ground truth)
observed <- test$position
observed


# The "predict" function returns a vector of predicted responses from a fitted tree.
# The "type" argument denotes the form of predicted value returned. The setting
# type = "class" will cause the response in a form of a vector of predicted 
# class labels.

predicted <- predict(dt, test, type = "class")
predicted

# confusion matrix
t <- table(observed, predicted)
t

# The diagonal elements in the confusion matrix represent the number of correctly 
# classified test instances

# The classification accuracy is the fraction of correctly classified test instances
sum(diag(t)) / sum(t)


# Let's write a function that calculates the classification accuracy
CA <- function(observed, predicted)
{
  t <- table(observed, predicted)
  
  sum(diag(t)) / sum(t)
}

# Function call
CA(observed, predicted)




# The setting type = "prob" will cause the predict function to 
# provide its answer in the form of a matrix with class probabilities.

predMat <- predict(dt, test, type = "prob")
predMat

# A matrix of the observed class probabilities (the ground truth) 
# (the real class has the probability of 1, others have 0)
obsMat <- model.matrix( ~ position-1, test)
obsMat


# IMPORTANT: check whether the columns refer to the same attributes
# (if not, change the order of columns)
colnames(predMat)
colnames(obsMat)


# The Brier score
brier.score <- function(observedMatrix, predictedMatrix)
{
  sum((observedMatrix - predictedMatrix) ^ 2) / nrow(predictedMatrix)
}

brier.score(obsMat, predMat)
